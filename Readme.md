## About this App
The Coffee Ordering Android App, "MyCoffee", is a  
simple one-page app that takes coffee orders from  
the users and sends those orders to the coffee shop  
owner through an email.  

## How the App works
The form asks for the customer's name, quantity of  
coffee and offers 2 choices of toppings.  

At last, it displays the total price of the order.  

There is an 'Order Now' button.  

The 'Order Now' button triggers an email to the  
coffee shop owner with the details of the order.  

To trigger an email, I used Android email intent.  

When the order button is clicked, the compose mail  
box of the phone email app is opened.  

After that, we can press the 'Send Mail' button to  
send the email to the shop owner.
